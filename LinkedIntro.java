    /*LinkedLists are often compared to ArrayLists.
        The main difference between them is that LinkedLists do not use indexes
        and the values are stored in different places in memory

        Removing a value at the start = O(1)
        Inserting a value at any point within the linkedList = O(n)

    /* What is a Node?
        a Node in a linkedList would be any individual "item"
        That is to say, a node is a value and its pointer 
        
        Think of it as a hashMap:
            
            {
                value = 6
                next = {
                            value = 3
                            next  = {
                                        ...*/
